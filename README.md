USC CSCI596 Scientific Computing and Visualization Course Final Project. <br>

# Introduction
Modelling and visualizing of doped helium nanodroplets and calculation of molecular interaction between study molecule and helium nanodroplet.

The helium droplet acts as a superfluid, this allows the doped molecule to be isolated and trapped. The molecule can then be trapped in intermediate energy states, this then allows certain structures to be captured and studied. <br>

The above diagram is the entire system used to generate the droplets and study the molecule.<br>
The molecule is studied by using an infrared laser. When the droplet containing the captured molecule is indent on with the laser at a particular frequency, the molecule resonates and the droplet is evaporated. The free molecule now is ionised and then detected.<br>
<br>
Objectives of this project is to calculate the molecular interactions between the dopant and the droplet and visualize the movement of droplet through the system.

# Output

Modeled a system to depict droplet lifecycle from formation to detection.
